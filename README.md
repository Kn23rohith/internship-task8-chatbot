# 🤖 ChatPy - Rule-Based Intelligent Chatbot

### 💼 Internship Task — Rule-Based Python Chatbot (Task 8)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**ChatPy** is a feature-rich, rule-based chatbot built purely using **Python's conditional logic** and `input()`/`print()` statements. It simulates intelligent, dynamic conversation flows on various real-world topics.

This project fulfills the internship task requirement:
> **“Build a Chatbot using if-else”** — using only Python, control flow, and user input.

The chatbot can carry full-length conversations, suggest real resources, offer logical help, share motivation, and even give **latest updates from sports and entertainment** — all through layered `if-elif-else` logic.
